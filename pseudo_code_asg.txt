Assignment: Area of Rectangle

· Create an algorithm pseudo-code to calculate area of rectangle with following formula:

Start 
	length = 5;
	width = 3;
	area = length * width;
	Output area;
End 


· Create an algorithm pseudo-code to calculate an area of rectangle with the same formula of previous example, with new condition where the length and width is given by user (input).

Start
	Input length;
	Input width;
	area = length * width;
	Output area;
